# Plugins

Source code of some of my type-safe published Roblox Studio plugins.
This repository may be out-of-sync with what is published on the Creator Store.

Source files use the extension .lua as opposed to .luau for ease of use in Roblox Studio.

All plugins are [licensed MIT](./LICENSE).

## [Auto Anchor](./AutoAnchor.lua)

Automatically anchors any newly-added descendant of Workspace. Can be toggled on and off.

## [Class Convert](./ClassConvert.lua)

Converts selected Instance into another class, preserving attributes, tags, descendants, and applicable properties.
Class Convert V2 can be found [here](https://github.com/Skekdog/ClassConvert); HOWEVER, FFLAGS MUST BE SET TO USE THAT PLUGIN. Class Convert V1 will continue to be maintained until ReflectionService is fully enabled.

Upload to Creator Store was moderated.

## [Bulk Save](./BulkSave.lua)

A simple tool to individually save all selected Instances with the filename set to their name.
Mostly just a time-saver.
